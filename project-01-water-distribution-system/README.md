# Water Distribution System Design and Analysis

## 1. Overview

This project involved the design and analysis of a water distribution system to meet specified flow and pressure requirements while satisfying safety, performance, and practical engineering constraints.

The objective was to develop a mechanically sound system architecture, size key components, and validate system performance through analytical methods. Emphasis was placed on engineering judgment, assumptions, and defensible design decisions rather than purely theoretical optimization.

## 2. Engineering Requirements and Constraints

Key requirements and constraints considered in the design included:

- Required volumetric flow rate at delivery points  
- Minimum and maximum allowable system pressures  
- Acceptable pressure losses throughout the system  
- Operating reliability and safety margins  
- Practical component selection (pipes, pumps, fittings)  
- Steady-state operating assumptions  

Where explicit requirements were not provided, conservative engineering assumptions were made and documented.

## 3. Mechanical Concepts Utilized

The following core mechanical engineering concepts were applied:

- Conservation of mass for steady incompressible flow  
- Energy balance using the Bernoulli equation  
- Head loss due to friction and fittings  
- Pump head and system curve interaction  
- Safety factors applied to pressure and performance limits  

These concepts formed the analytical basis for system sizing and performance evaluation.

## 4. Engineering Approach and Design Decisions

The system was decomposed into functional segments to enable structured analysis. Pipe diameters were selected based on target flow velocities and acceptable friction losses. Pressure losses were calculated for both major losses (pipe friction) and minor losses (fittings and components).

Pump selection was guided by the intersection of the system curve and candidate pump performance curves, prioritizing operating efficiency and adequate margin over minimum requirements.

Design decisions were evaluated against system requirements, with trade-offs documented where multiple viable solutions existed.

## 5. Analysis and Validation

Analytical calculations were performed to:

- Determine total dynamic head requirements  
- Quantify pressure losses across system components  
- Validate flow consistency throughout the network  
- Confirm operating points within acceptable pressure limits  

Assumptions such as steady-state operation, incompressible flow, and constant fluid properties were explicitly stated and considered when interpreting results.

## 6. Results

The final system design met all specified performance requirements under the defined assumptions. Calculated pressures and flow rates remained within acceptable operating ranges, and selected components provided sufficient margin for reliable operation.

The analysis demonstrated that the proposed configuration achieved the desired performance without unnecessary overdesign.

## 7. Deliverables

Project deliverables included:

- System schematic and layout

- Application of fundamental fluid mechanics to real systems  
- Engineering judgment in the absence of fully defined requirements  
- Structured system-level problem solving  
- Clear documentation of assumptions and limitations
